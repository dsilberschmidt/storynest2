## ðŸ§ª Experimental Branch: voice-experiment

We explored voice input with AIMLAPI using the Whisper model in a separate branch: [`voice-experiment`](https://github.com/tuusuario/storynest2/tree/voice-experiment)

### Current status:
- Audio recording and upload via MediaRecorder works
- AIMLAPI currently rejects audio/webm with 400 errors
- Further integration would require format conversion (e.g., with ffmpeg)

This branch is **not part of the submitted MVP**, but documents technical exploration for future features.
